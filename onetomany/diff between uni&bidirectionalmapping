note:source meansparent,target means child
Difference between uni&bi-directional mappings(@OneTomany):
1)
in unidirectional mapping we have (@OneTomany):Annotation at source entity only
in bi-directional mapping we have (@OneTomany):Annotation at source and @ManytoOne at  target entities
 
2)
in unidirectional mapping we have reference in only source entity which refers target entity
in bidirectional mapping we have references in both source and target entities for each(explanation:
like in source it have target reference and in target it have source reference),
The source entity must use the mappedBy attribute to define the bidirectional one-to-many mapping.(mappedBy="reference declared in target entity")
3)
in unidirectional mapping we have a seperate table created(if we mention @JoinColumn annotation in source entity above reference of target entity
then foreign key created in target table)
in bidirectional mapping we have  foreign key in target table
4)
 unidirectional mapping  provides navigational access in  one direction 
bidirectional relationship provides navigational access in both directions
