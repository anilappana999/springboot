note:source meansparent,target means child
Difference between uni&bi-directional mappings(@ManyToMany):
1)
in unidirectional mapping we have @ManyToManyAnnotation at source entity only
in bi-directional mapping we have @ManyToManyAnnotation at both source and target entities
 
2)
in unidirectional mapping we have reference in only source entity which refers target entity
, seperate table is created here for showing relationship b/w tables, we can also give custom name for it in source entity
in bidirectional mapping we have references in both source and target entities for each(explanation:
like in source it have target reference and in target it have source reference)
The source entity must use the mappedBy attribute to define the bidirectional one-to-one mapping.(mappedBy="reference declared in target entity")
seperate table is created here for showing relationship b/w tables we can also give custom name for it in target entity

4)
 unidirectional mapping  provides navigational access in  one direction 
bidirectional relationship provides navigational access in both directions
