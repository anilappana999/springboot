note:source meansparent,target means child
Difference between uni&bi-directional mappings(@OneToOne):
1)
in unidirectional mapping we have @OneToOne Annotation at source entity only
in bi-directional mapping we have @OneToOne Annotation at both source and target entities
 
2)
in unidirectional mapping we have reference in only source entity which refers target entity
in bidirectional mapping we have references in both source and target entities for each(explanation:
like in source it have target reference and in target it have source reference),
The source entity must use the mappedBy attribute to define the bidirectional one-to-one mapping.(mappedBy="reference declared in target entity")
3)
in unidirectional mapping we have foreign key in source table
in bidirectional mapping we have foreign key in target table
4)
 unidirectional mapping  provides navigational access in  one direction 
bidirectional relationship provides navigational access in both directions
